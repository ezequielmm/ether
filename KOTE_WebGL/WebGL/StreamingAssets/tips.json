    "Take your time to decide the order in which you play the cards in your hand, some cards are better used after others!",
    "Use your mouse to hover over the 'Statuses' underneath your characters health bar to see descriptions of how they work.",
    "Use your mouse to hover over the 'Intents' above enemies in order to find out what they mean.",
    "Some cards 'Exhaust' after being played. This means they can only be used once per combat. You'll get the card back for your next combat.",
    "Your 'Energy' counter is the blue circle on the left side of your screen. Make sure to watch your energy carefully and plan your plays based on how much you have each turn.",
    "You have a 'Draw Pile' and a 'Discard Pile' on the left and right of your hand. Click them to see which cards you will draw next, or which cards will take a while before they are shuffled back into your hand.",
    "Some numerical values on your cards change based on your statuses. For example, attack cards show the extra damage you will deal when you have extra 'Resolve'.",
    "Scroll to the right on the map to plan out the optimal path.",
    "Elite Monsters are harder to kill and harder to survive than Basic Monsters.",
    "There are 2 different Bosses you can face in Stage 1, Treant or Fungal Brute.",
    "Sometimes it's better to NOT take a card in combat rewards. The best decks are focused and uncluttered by unnecessary cards."
